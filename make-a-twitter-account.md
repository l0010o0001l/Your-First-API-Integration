![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-03-30 at 9.15.32 PM.png)

* If you don't already have a Twitter account or don't want to post horoscopes on your existing account, create a new Twitter account at [https://twitter.com/signup](https://twitter.com/signup) \(don't worry about picking a perfect username, it can be changed later\).

* **Note**: if you've created a Twitter account before, you won't be allowed to use the same phone number to sign up for a new account. You can sign up for a free phone number at [https://www.google.com/voice](https://www.google.com/voice)  
  that will forward to your existing number.

* If you would like, this is a good time to go to your account settings and turn off mobile and email notifications.

* Visit [https://apps.twitter.com/app/new](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) to create a new Twitter application for this account. This will give us credentials that will allow our Sinatra app to tweet on this account's behalf.

Note: The information you enter here won't be used by the app, but make sure the \(arbitrary\) website you enter begins with "http."

* Once you have created an application for your account, visit the **Keys and Access Tokens** section.
* Create a new access token.

Leave this page open, we'll come back to it in the chapter on environment variables.
