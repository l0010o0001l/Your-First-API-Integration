# What is an API?

In the world of web applications, an API is a set of urls that you can use to access or create data on a website. More generally, an API can be any set of instructions for any kind of software, but today we're just concerned with the use of APIs for **getting stuff from and** **making stuff** **on websites**.

You can think of an API as a way for you to make a robot that uses a website the same way you do, only automatically. For example, for some reason you might want to tweet the message "I AM HAVING BREAKFAST" at 10 AM every morning. Instead of doing that yourself, you could make a robot that does that for you, using the Twitter API!
