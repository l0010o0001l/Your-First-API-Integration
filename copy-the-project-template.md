# Copy the project template
For the rest of this tutorial, you'll need to use a **terminal** to copy the project template and run the code you'll be writing. If you don't already have one installed, I recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net/) for Windows and [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) for Mac.

* Fork the "API Horoscope" template at [https://github.com/spinecone/api-horoscope](https://github.com/spinecone/api-horoscope) (by forking this template, you'll be able to keep changes you make to separate from the original template).
* Now you've got your own copy of the horoscope template! To use it, visit https://github.com/your_username/api-horoscope
* Next, copy the HTTPS clone url for the fork (it should resemble https://github.com/your_username]/api-horoscope.git)

* Open a terminal window and type `git clone the-url-you-just-copied`
* Finally, type `cd api-horoscope` to enter the directory you just created.

# What did we just do?

When you "fork" a GitHub repository, you're taking a project someone else has written \(in this case, the api-horoscope template\), and creating a copy of it that you can make changes to. The changes you make on your fork won't affect the original repository. You can read more about forking [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
