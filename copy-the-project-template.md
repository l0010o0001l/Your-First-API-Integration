* Fork the "API Horoscope" template at [https://github.com/spinecone/api-horoscope](https://github.com/spinecone/api-horoscope)
* By forking this template, you'll be able to keep changes you make to separate from the original template.

# What did we just do?

When you "fork" a GitHub repository, you're taking a project someone else has written \(in this case, the api-horoscope template\), and creating a copy of it that you can make changes to. The changes you make on your fork won't affect the original repository. You can read more about forking [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
