# Choosing an API

The APIs used in this tutorial were chosen because they are:

* **Free** (some APIs charge a subscription or one-time fee, or start to charge fees once you use them a certain amount\)
* **Public **\(some APIs are completely private, or require you to apply to use them, with different selection criteria and wait times. We don't have time for that nonsense.\)
* **Well documented **\(both Twitter and Wikipedia have in-depth, up to date instructions for their APIs. Many APIs don't even have  documentation! ðŸ˜±)
