# What is Sinatra?

The horoscope app only uses a single page and \(when you've finished this tutorial\) 2 different requests. Ruby on Rails, the web application framework you may be more familiar with, makes a lot of assumptions about the kind of applications being built with it. It assumes you're going to be using a database and at least a few different requests, at a minimum. We don't need any of that. Sinatra makes none of these assumptions so it's perfect for this kind of application.
